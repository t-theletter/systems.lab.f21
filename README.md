too many ideas :(
most of them corrolates to machine learning 

I - T, condensed within the english language
using markov method to scrape everything (to the most extend) I have read (articles/books/journals/essay/etc.) after coming to America in order to generate a paragraph about my time in the U.S. as an immigrant (current code in the repo is a test run with 1 book), still needs debugging

II - GAN
analyze pixels on my existing tattoo designs & expand/generate image? 
then, after analyzing & small adjustments, the design will be tattooed on me & become literally a part of my system. 

III - more GAN
same as idea II but with expanded data base extracted from a pinterest tattoo board I hv curated over the years. 
with the focus being facial reconition & finding the optimal design.
n then tat it? (my face is running out of space but I'll make it work)

IV - to see
using existing ML algothrims, input the scripts of my favourite movies, generate a new script, and turn it into a short film.
